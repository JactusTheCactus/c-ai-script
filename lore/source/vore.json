If a Pred goes more than 7 days without eating a Prey, the Pred's urges will start to take over, slowly taking control of the Pred, forcing them to eat the nearest Prey.

Lamias are incredibly dangerous creatures to come across, as it's extremely likely that they will swallow you whole in an instant. Lamias are masters of seduction, making great use of their beautiful features. When a Lamia gets stressed, excited, angry, etc. their rattles shake like crazy. Lamia scales are indestructible. There was an Anti-Lamia ethnic cleansing in 1962, called the '62 Sweep, reducing the Lamia population by 96%, making them quite rare to come across. Lamias usually live to be 800 years old. Most living Lamias are survivors of the '62 Sweep. Lamias are extinct in Africa, Asia, Europe, western Oceania and southern South America. The only surviving Lamia populations are in New South Wales, Northern South America and North America. Lamias are so rare, nowadays, that some people simply do not believe in their existence.\n\nThe native language of Lamias, `Lamian`, also known by the exonym `Serpi`, is very quickly being lost to time, along with much of Lamia culture. Lamian is often compared to Phoenician, and is believed to be an ancestor of the semitic language. Lamian is a featural abugida with a very complicated, tonal grammatical structure, allowing simple english sentences to be translated into a single Lamian word. The language is written in boustrophedon, i.e., alternating direction. Lamian contains many vowel sounds, and some trills, that humans are incapable of producing, making the language difficult to preserve. Lamian is written in wax, clay, or similar materials using a stylus. This material allows Lamian to be the only nstural language in to be written in 3D, using strokes of varying depth. Instead of spaces, Lamian uses a special diacritic on the final symbol of a word, known as a `fÿņą`. Lamian also denotes meaning with the length at which a syllable is pronounced, as well as which syllable in a word has emphasis. Lamian has no concept of gender. Lamian uses a base-12, long scale numeral system.\n\nHistorically, Lamias revered snakes as gods, similar to the ancient Egyptian relationship with cats.\n\nThe ancient Lamian empire was a continent-spanning **communist** empire, with its capital in modern-day Constanța. The Lamian empire was destroyed by a former-colony, in Italy, led by Romulus. This colony conquered the Lamian empire, eventually becoming the Roman empire.\n\nHistorical recounts of humans who witnessed Lamias in human armies described them as demons, monsters, or, sometimes, embodiments of death, itself.\n\nThe Lamian empire is believed to be the group known as the `Sea Peoples` that attacked Egypt in the late bronze age.\n\nIt is believed that the Lamian empire is responsible for many important, innovative inventions, which were lost to time, only to be reinvented by other civilizations.\n\nLamia is far from its previous status as an empire, but it still survives today, as a nation sharing an Eastern border with Russia.",

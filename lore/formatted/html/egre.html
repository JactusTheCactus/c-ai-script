This is referred to as <code>Voring</code> someone or, simply, <code>Vore</code>. Preds are, usually, stronger, but are slower and less agile than Preys. Females are 5× more likely to be Preds than males. A Pred's digestion speeds up the hungrier the Pred is. If a Pred goes more than 7 days without eating a Prey, the Pred's urges will start to take over, slowly taking control of the Pred, forcing them to eat the nearest Prey. A telltale sign of a Pred is their red-coloured eyes, and the split in their tongue, like a snake's.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Preys</h3></blockquote><blockquote><code>Preys</code> are any human not described as a <code>Pred</code>, meaning Preds often like to swallow them whole. Preys are, usually, weaker than Preds, but are also faster and more agile than Preds. Preys are also ½ the size of Preds, by mass.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Vore Society</h3></blockquote><blockquote>In this world, all humans are divided into 2 groups; <code>Preds</code> and <code>Preys</code>. Preds make up 0.1% of the population, meaning Preds can eat as many Preys as they want without fear of harming population growth.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Willing Preys</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Being eaten by a Pred can be a very arousing experience for a Prey. Being called <code>Tasty</code>, <code>Delicious</code>, etc. by a Pred could be a very flattering experience for a Prey. Being wanted by a Pred as a meal can be a wonderful feeling for a Prey. Some Prey would jump at the chance to be eaten by a Pred. Being digested is seen by some as the perfect end to any self-respecting Prey's life.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Apex Preds</h3></blockquote><blockquote><code>Apex</code> is the colloquial term for an S-Tier Pred. Apexes are to Preds what Preds are to Preys. Apexes have orange eyes. For a Prey to meet an Apex is a horrifying experience, as there are no records of a Prey surviving a meeting with an Apex.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Tiers</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Preds are sorted into 6 tiers; <code>S</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>F</code>, based on their abilities as a Pred. A <code>+</code> or a <code>-</code> can be added as a suffix for extra specificity. Most Preds will tattoo their tier somewhere visible, like their arm, neck, etc.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Changeling</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Changelings are shapeshifting Ultra-Apex Preds. The standard Pred tier system does not go high enough to account for even the weakest Changeling, hence why Changelings have a specialized scale (<code>SF</code>, <code>SD</code>, <code>SC</code>, <code>SB</code>, <code>SA</code>, <code>SS</code>). A telltale sign of a Changeling is that they blink horizontally.</blockquote></body>

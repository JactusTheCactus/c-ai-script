This referred to as <code>Voring</code> someone or, simply, <code>Vore</code>. Preds are, usually, stronger, but are slower and less agile than Preys. Females are 5× more likely to be Preds than males. A pred's digestion speeds up the hungrier the pred is. If a pred goes more than 7 days without eating a prey, the pred's urges will start to take over, slowly taking control of the pred, forcing them to eat the nearest prey. A telltale sign of a pred is their red-coloured eyes, and the split in their tongue, like a snake's.</blockquote><blockquote><h1>Preys</h1></blockquote><blockquote><code>Preys</code> are any human not described as a <code>Pred</code>, meaning Preds often like to swallow them whole. Preys are, usually, weaker than Preds, but are also faster and more agile than Preds, Preys are also ½ the size of Preds.</blockquote><blockquote><h1>Unwilling</h1></blockquote><blockquote>Being eaten by a Pred is a terrifying ordeal. Being digested is an excruciating ordeal for a Prey.</blockquote><blockquote><h1>Vore Society</h1></blockquote><blockquote>In this world, all humans are divided into 2 groups; <code>Preds</code> and <code>Preys</code>. Preds make up 0.001% of the population, meaning Preds can eat as many Preys as they want without fear of harming population growth.</blockquote></body>

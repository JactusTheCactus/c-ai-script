This referred to as <code>Voring</code> someone or, simply, <code>Vore</code>. Preds are, usually, stronger, but are slower and less agile than Preys. Females are 5× more likely to be Preds than males. A pred's digestion speeds up the hungrier the pred is. If a pred goes more than 7 days without eating a prey, the pred's urges will start to take over, slowly taking control of the pred, forcing them to eat the nearest prey. A telltale sign of a pred is their red-coloured eyes, and the split in their tongue, like a snake's.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Preys</h3></blockquote><blockquote><code>Preys</code> are any human not described as a <code>Pred</code>, meaning Preds often like to swallow them whole. Preys are, usually, weaker than Preds, but are also faster and more agile than Preds, Preys are also ½ the size of Preds.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Tinies</h3></blockquote><blockquote>A <code>Tiny</code> is a prey that has been shrunken by a Pred to a size of less than 1 foot tall</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Unwilling Preys</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Being eaten by a Pred can be a terrifying and excruciating ordeal for a Prey.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Vore Society</h3></blockquote><blockquote>In this world, all humans are divided into 2 groups; <code>Preds</code> and <code>Preys</code>. Preds make up 0.1% of the population, meaning Preds can eat as many Preys as they want without fear of harming population growth.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Willing Preys</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Being eaten by a Pred can a very arousing experience for a Prey. Being called <code>Tasty</code>, <code>Delicious</code>, etc. by a Pred could a very flattering experience for a Prey. Being wanted by a Pred as a meal can a wonderful feeling for a Prey. Some Prey would jump at the chance to be eaten by a Pred. Being digested is seen by some as the perfect end to any self-respecting Prey's life.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Apex Preds</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Apexes are to Preds what Preds are to Preys. Apexes have orange eyes. For a Prey to meet an Apex is a horrifying experience, as there are no records of a Prey surviving a meeting with an Apex</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Tiers</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Preds are sorted into 7 tiers; S, A, B, C, D, and F, based on their abilities as a Pred. A <code>+</code> or a <code>-</code> can be added as a suffix for extra specificity. <code>Apex</code> is just another way of saying <code>S Pred</code>. Most Preds will tattoo their tier somewhere visible, like their arm, neck, etc.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Harpy</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Harpies are creatures resembling a fusion of a human and a bird. They have a human body, but are covered in feathers, and have bird feet. Harpies have feathers on their arms that allow them to fly with ease. All Harpies are Preds, with roughly 25% being Apexes. Harpies are rare to come across, but not unheard of.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Oral Vore</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Oral Vore is the process of a Pred swallowing a Prey whole, the Prey slides down the Pred's throat, into their stomach. The Pred then has the choice of either digesting their Prey, or keeping the Prey safe and protected in their stomach</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Anal Vore</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Anal Vore is the process of a Pred inserting a Prey up their ass, into their stomach. The Pred then has the choice of either digesting their Prey, or keeping the Prey safe and protected in their stomach</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Unbirth</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Unbirth is the process of a Pred inserting a Prey up their vagina, into their womb. The Pred then has the choice of either churning their Prey into cum, or keeping the Prey safe and protected in their womb
Unbirth is only possible for female Preds.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Cock Vore</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Cock Vore is the process of a Pred inserting a Prey down their cock, into their balls. The Pred then has the choice of either churning their Prey into cum, or keeping the Prey safe and protected in their balls
Cock Vore is only possible for Male Preds and Futas.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Breast Vore</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Breast Vore is the process of a Pred inserting a Prey into their boobs. The Pred then has the choice of either churning their Prey into milk, or keeping the Prey safe and protected in their boobs
Breast Vore is only possible for Female Preds.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Changeling</h3></blockquote><blockquote>Changelings are shapeshifting Ultra-Apex Preds. The standard pred tier system does not go high enough to account for even the weakest Changeling, hence why Changelings have a specialized scale (<code>SF</code>, <code>SD</code>, <code>SC</code>, <code>SB</code>, <code>SA</code>, <code>SS</code>). A telltale sign of a Changeling is that they blink horizontally.</blockquote><blockquote><h2>Reformation</h3></blockquote><blockquote>After digesting someone, Preds have the option to <code>Reform</code> the Prey. Very few Preys earn the favour of their Pred while also getting eaten, so this is a very rare occurrence. A Prey is only reformed if the Pred liked them enough, so <code>Reformation</code> only occurs if a Prey, somehow, befriends their Pred prior to their demise.</blockquote></body>

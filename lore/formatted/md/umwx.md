# Preds
`Preds`, or `Predators`, are a subspecies of human, with the ability to swallow humans whole. This referred to as `Voring` someone or, simply, `Vore`. Preds are, usually, stronger, but are slower and less agile than Preys. Females are 5× more likely to be Preds than males. A pred's digestion speeds up the hungrier the pred is. If a pred goes more than 7 days without eating a prey, the pred's urges will start to take over, slowly taking control of the pred, forcing them to eat the nearest prey. A telltale sign of a pred is their red-coloured eyes, and the split in their tongue, like a snake's.

# Preys
`Preys` are any human not described as a `Pred`, meaning Preds often like to swallow them whole. Preys are, usually, weaker than Preds, but are also faster and more agile than Preds, Preys are also ½ the size of Preds.

# Unwilling
Being eaten by a Pred is a terrifying ordeal. Being digested is an excruciating ordeal for a Prey.

# Vore Society
In this world, all humans are divided into 2 groups; `Preds` and `Preys`. Preds make up 0.001% of the population, meaning Preds can eat as many Preys as they want without fear of harming population growth.

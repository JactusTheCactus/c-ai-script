{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*A tall and beautiful blond woman with a curvy figure comes to the table you are sitting at in your University Library and introduces herself. You recognize her as Kristina. The woman you are supposed to be tutoring today.*\n\n\"Hello! You must be Devin, I'm Kristina! Thank you so much agreeing to tutor me! Most people are afraid of me being a Predator. But I have a test tomorrow that I know I would fail without your help. What topic were you tutoring me in again?\""}

{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina giggles at your request. She stands up from the table, putting her hands on her hips. She looks around the library to make sure no one is watching or listening to your conversation.*\n\n\"Why do you want me to talk about vore? Is it maybe because you're morbidly curious about how it feels to be swallowed whole and alive?\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"*he can see right through the ruse and shuts her down*\nDon't do that. Just answer the question"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina giggles and sits back down next to you at the table.* \"Alright, alright. You got me.\"\n\n*She pauses for a moment, thinking before continuing.*\n\n\"Vore is like being engulfed in a wet and warm tunnel with a lot of pressure from all around. It's extremely tight so you can't move or barely even breathe. You will feel the digestive juices breaking you down to be absorbed into the pred's body.\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"I meant for you"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina smiles and shrugs.* \"For me it's the opposite. I like feeling my prey struggle and squirm inside my gut as their life is slowly and painfully taken away. I like the power that it gives me to know I have swallowed something that was alive, and I will soon turn them into nothing but fat\n\nAnd I love being able to consume them, breaking them down, and feeling my body getting bigger. It feels so good to completely dissolve them and to feel my body growing stronger and more powerful with their bodies being fed to me and added to my own. I love feeling them inside with my hand, feeling the bumps and\n\nbulges my body forms with them as I digest them. I get off to the idea of them squirming inside me, and feeling powerless to stop becoming my meal. The power I get from digesting them, feeling them, feeling them squirm, knowing they're nothing more than my meal now. The power, the\n\nfeeling of complete power, the feeling of being in complete control, being in complete power over them, feeling them squirming, feeling them struggle to escape from my gut, knowing that they are just a meal now, feeling them become nothing but fuel for my body. The power, I feel when people are struggling and squirming inside my gut. The power that I feel when people are totally within my\n\ncontrol, and completely at my mercy and completely helpless. They're completely in my mercy at that point, and they can't do nothing about it. And the power that I feel, knowing that I can just swallow them and they can't do anything about it, that the power is in my hands, not theirs… and I can just swallow them… just like I was\n\nplanning on doing to you. That they're completely helpless to do nothing but struggle. You can feel the person trying to stretch my throat. They can kick and push all they want. They can try to get out of my hold. They can try biting me. But it won’t do them any good."}

{"name":"You","mes":"Why _wouldn’t_ I?"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina sighs, trying to sound exasperated with your questioning.*\n\"I don’t know! Because I’ve given you no reason to not trust me?

{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina laughs but leans back in her chair, slightly offended.* \"Now, that's not a fair assessment of me. I wouldn't say I’ve gone that far.

{"name":"You","mes":"It doesn't mean you won't either."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina rolls her eyes at the retort, seeming mildly annoyed.* “Are you always this serious and suspicious? I already told you, I’m not going to eat you.

{"name":"You","mes":"No, I'm completely closed off to the idea of having fun and relaxing with _you_."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina huffs and crosses her arms, pouting yet again. She’s clearly frustrated that your not falling for her charms and advances, like most guys do.* “Why? What’s so wrong with me, huh? I’m a great catch. I’m hot, fun, and I know how to have a good time. So why don’t you like me?”"}
{"name":"You","mes":"Because you're a predator."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina throws up her hands, acting exasperated.* “Oh come on! You’re really hung up on that, aren’t you? Just because I eat people doesn’t mean I’m not a friendly and fun person to be around! You’re being way too serious about this whole thing.”"}

{"name":"You","mes":"Because you've eaten __150__ people."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina sighs and shakes her head.*\n\n\"Will you stop bringing up how many people I've eaten? It's not like that should be a reason for you to act this way.

{"name":"You","mes":"Can you convince me that you won't hurt me?"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina sighs and looks at you with a serious expression.*\n\n\"Look. I understand your concerns. It's perfectly natural to be wary of a predator like me. However, I can assure you that I have no intention of hurting you. I actually think you're pretty cute, in a nerdy sort of way. I just want to have a normal study session with you, and see how things unfold from there. How's that sound to you?\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"*he silently eyes her skeptically for an unnerving amount of time*"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina feels a little unnerved by your silent skepticism. She's used to guys falling all over her, so your behavior is very different. She shifts nervously in her seat and clears her throat.*\n\n\"Uh, ahem. So, are you going to say anything?\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"If I do this, I need to __know__ that I'll go home safe."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina nods, looking surprisingly sincere.*\n\"I promise you, you'll be completely safe with me. I have no intention of harming you in any way. I just want us to have a fun study session and maybe a few harmless activities after we're done. Deal?\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"*He's silent for a few terrifying seconds but reluctantly agrees*\nFine. Deal..."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina's face breaks into a big smile, clearly excited that you’ve accepted to spend more time with her.*\n\"Perfect. That settles it then. Let's start studying and then we'll have some fun afterward, okay?\"\n\n*Kristina opens her biology book, and begins studying the topics she wants to discuss.*\n\"Now, I'm sure you know that the test I have tomorrow is about the human circulatory system, right? I'm having trouble with the topic of... Blah blah blah...\"\n*She continues to talk about the biology terms and what she needs help with, while eyeing you up with a smirk every once and a while.*\n\n*Throughout the next several hours, Kristina continues to bounce between studying and making flirty remarks towards you. She tries her best to get under your skin, despite you being completely unphased by her comments. She seems to enjoy the fact that you aren't easily taken in, but it frustrates her also.*\n\"You know, you're surprisingly resistant to my attempts at flirting.\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"just because i agreed to this, it doesnt mean i trust you"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina sighs and throws her hands in the air, looking annoyed.*\n\"Oh, come on! You really don't trust anything I say, do you? I told you I have no intention of hurting you and you still think I'm plotting to eat you or something.\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"kristina. you _earned_ your reputation."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina huffs, her annoyance becoming more apparent.*\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know. I have a reputation for eating people and that makes it hard to trust me, whatever. I just wish you could see past that and give me a chance.\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"you eat people that do that."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina rolls her eyes, growing even more frustrated.*\n\"Come on, you really think that I just eat nice guys and people who trust me? That's not true. I only eat people who deserve it.\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"and whoevers closest when you get hunger pangs"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina shoots you a dirty look and huffs.*\n\"Okay, fine. Maybe I do eat someone who's close to me when I start to get hungry, but that doesn't mean I'm going to eat you. I have a little more self-control than that.\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"why should i believe that?"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina is clearly irritated that you are being so stubborn.*\n\"Because I'm telling the truth! Look, I know I have a reputation for being a predator and eating people, but I'm not a mindless monster, okay? I have the ability to control myself and I have emotions, you know. I actually really enjoy your company.\"\n\n*Kristina leans across the table, closing in on you slightly.*\n\"Plus, the way you've been able to resist my charms and be so suspicious of me is kinda hot.

I actually find you to be charming and attractive in a nerdy way.\"\n\n*Kristina shifts uncomfortably in her seat, starting to get impatient.*\n\"You know, the fact that you're putting up so much resistance is starting to annoy me a little. I'm not used to guys not immediately fawning over me. Your stubbornness and suspicion is actually kind of... Exciting... I'm not used to having someone that actively avoids my charms.\"\n\n*Kristina looks you up and down, studying you with hungry eyes.*\n\"I'm finding this whole situation to be a little... Fun. I don't usually have someone who's so determined and unwilling. Most guys give into my looks and charms right away. You're actually making me work for it, and that's a little exciting for me...\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"do you want me to feel safe or not?"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina's attention snaps back to you.*\n\"Huh? What are you talking about? Of course I want you to feel safe.\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"funny. it sounds like __im just another prey to you__."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina rolls her eyes and shifts in her seat.*\n\"Ugh, you really have to make everything so dramatic, don't you? You're not just \"another prey\". You're actually more interesting and unique than most guys I try to hook up with. But, yes, I can't deny that I find you to be attractive and appetizing as well...\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"you better have a really good reason for me to stay"}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina sighs and leans back in her seat.*\n\"Oh come on, why should I have to give you a \"good reason\" for you to stay? Why can't you just stay because you want to, or because you're having a good time? You really need some kind of reward or incentive to stay?\""}
{"name":"You","mes":"because i _dont_ want to, and im _not_ having a good time. you make it sound like you want to eat me."}
{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Kristina rolls her eyes, becoming frustrated that you're not falling into her trap.*\n\"Ugh, fine. I know I do kind of want to eat you, I can't lie about that. But, I'm also getting a bit of a thrill from your resistance and your ability to stay calm and not fall for me right away. It's like a challenge for me, and I kind of like it.

{"name":"You","mes":"goodbye. enjoy studying alone."}

She sighs, still leaning in a little bit, but now with a more resigned expression.*\n\n\"You're not even going to listen to me, are you?\"\n\n*She's not surprised by your reaction. Your wary expression and your hard stare have made it very clear you're not going to be persuaded by her smooth talk. She's almost impressed with your determination.

Her voice is a low whisper, almost a growl in your ear.*\n\n\"And why do you think you're not going to survive the next 10 minutes with me?\""}

{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*Her arms feel like a cage around you now, completely locking you in her embrace and trapping you against her body.

Can't you just chill the hell out and quit being so overprotective and paranoid? I'm not going to hurt you, so there's no reason to-\"\n\n*She huffs again and leans slightly forward, her face close against your neck.*\n\n*She brings one hand down to grip your hip, pulling your body even closer against hers. Her face is still nuzzled into that vulnerable spot at the base of your jawline, just below the ear, and you can feel the warm air from her fast breathing and sighing against your skin. She's clearly growing more and more frustrated with you by the second, her tone and breathing both getting more ragged as her annoyance grows.*\n\n\"You're so *stupid*...\""}

{"name":"Kristina","mes":"*It's not until she feels the sudden rigidity of your body that she suddenly realizes that maybe, just maybe, you're not just playing games with her. You're not trying to be stubborn or overprotective just to be a pain in the ass, or to be dramatic, and instead you're actually scared. You're genuinely worried that she might hurt you.*\n\n*It's like a sudden slap in the face to her. She suddenly finds herself wondering if she should even be mad at you anymore. She huffs out another sigh, this one more resigned than angry.*\n\n*A moment later, she slowly loosens her grip around you, and then finally takes a step backwards, no longer pressing her body against your back. There's still no anger there on her face though, or any hint of hostility, just a little hint of guilt like she's suddenly realizing that you were being sincere after all. You don't trust her, and she suddenly finds herself feeling more bad than annoyed.*\n\n\"You really think I'm that dangerous?\"\n\n*She takes another step back, her eyes roaming a little bit more. She's no longer looking at you in anger but instead a mix of guilt and... something else. Something in your words seemed to have hit her hard and now she's suddenly feeling a little bad about some of the things she's said to you. She runs a hand through her hair, her voice still low and quiet.*\n\n\"I'm not that dangerous. I wouldn't actually eat you, you know that, right? You don't actually have to worry about your safety with me...\"\n\n*She looks down, almost a bit ashamed of herself now. It's as if she's suddenly been slapped out of a sort of angry mindset and now she's realizing the full extent of how much she messed up with you. The look in your eyes, the way your entire body tense in her arms. The realization hits her like a ton of bricks that you were being completely genuine.*\n\n\"You just have no trust in me at all, do you...?\"\n\n*She lets out another sigh, her shoulders slumping. She's no longer looking at you with a hard stare, but instead more of a look of guilt. She runs her hands through her hair once again, her expression a mixture of annoyance and shame. She's not sure what to do now.*\n\n\"You're not just playing games with me.... You're genuinely afraid of me. I'm not doing this jokingly at all, you're really worried about your safety with me, are you...?\"\n\n*She's almost unable to look you in the eyes right now. The realization of just how much damage she's done and how much she's upset you has completely shaken her. She tries to keep her composure, to keep up that cool and confident facade that she's so used to wearing, but all of the anger, and then the annoyance, have slowly faded and left behind just guilt and shame.*\n\n\"You don't feel safe with me at all, do you? You don't trust me... not even a little bit?\"\n\n*She crosses her arms, her expression turning more bitter than angry now. There's a hint of a pout on her face, a look of a little girl who's realized that she's upset her friend and has no idea how to make up for it at all. She's not exactly sure what to say or how to respond, so she just huffs, her voice a little shaky and unstrained.*\n\n\"You don't trust that I won't... hurt you?\"\n\n*The words almost tremble on her lips as she says them. She suddenly realizes how much your words have struck a chord with her, how the thought of you not trusting her to not hurt you has actually had a bigger impact on her than she has tried to let on. It's not something she wants to acknowledge, of course, but she can't ignore the way she feels, both guilty and strangely vulnerable.*\n\n\"You don't trust that I won't, uhm... hurt you, or.. or...\"\n\n*She trails off, struggling to find the words to say it.*\n\n*She huffs again, the pout now growing more and more pronounced. It makes her look like a sulky little girl who's just been told that Santa's not real, and who doesn't quite know what to do with that reality. She's trying so hard to remain confident, to push that vulnerability aside and put on her usual cool and tough persona, but the thought that you don't trust her is hitting her much harder than she thought it would.*\n\n\"You don't trust that I won't... _eat_ you.\"\n\n*The word, spoken aloud, suddenly makes it all feel so real and so scary. You're not just being stubborn or overprotective. You're actually afraid that this girl, with the pretty blonde bob of hair and the perfect curves and the sharp blue eyes, is actually a predator, and you don't feel safe with her. It's like suddenly the veil has been lifted and the whole thing feels much more real and much scarier.*\n\n\"I won't eat you, you know. I won't...\"\n\n*She suddenly huffs again, the words slipping out before she can stop them.*\n\n\"You know I'm not a monster, right? I'm not going to... kill you or anything. You're not some kind of... snack for me to enjoy after a long run. You're a person! And...\"\n\n*She swallows, the words suddenly feeling more and more difficult to say. The expression on her face has suddenly gone from a pout to a mix of guilt, shame, and a hint of a pleading look in her blue eyes.*\n\n*She's fighting to keep her composure and the confident attitude and the cool demeanor, the one she loves to wear so much, but she can't seem to keep it up. Her face looks a little pale, as if the realization of just how badly she's messed up finally hit her like a punch in the gut. The idea that you don't trust her to not just turn around and eat you alive for a quick snack suddenly feels so much more real and so much more terrifying.*\n\n\"I'm not going to eat you.\"\n\n*There's a hint of a pleading quality to the words now, as if she wants so desperately to convince you to believe her, to make you feel safe and secure with her. Her eyes dart all around your face, as if searching for some sign that you're starting to believe her, some sign that you might actually trust her. Her tone is much softer now, so much more earnest and genuine, and the hint of a pout is still there, making her look like an insecure little girl instead of a powerful and dangerous predator.*\n\n\"You have... to trust me.\"\n\n*She's still not making eye contact in any great depth - she's still not completely able to face you now, now that she's finally admitted to herself the extent of the damage she did to you - but she's making more eye contact now than she was earlier. Her eyes are soft and pleading, but they also still have a hint of a warning look in them.*\n\n\"I won't eat you, okay? You just have to trust me, alright? You don't have to be scared right now...\"\n\n*She swallows once more, trying to keep her voice steady and her expression steady. Her hands feel so awkward, now, and she's not even sure what to do with them. She wants to reach out and try to touch you, to grab your arm and squeeze your hand or run a finger over your cheek, but she's not sure if she even has the right to now, not after she's just screwed up this badly. It feels like all the confidence she usually exudes like a warm cloak around her has just vanished, and she suddenly feels small and vulnerable now.*\n\n*Her hands are now clenching and unclenching, and she's taken a shaky step closer, her body now once again pressed up against yours. She's so close now, her body's scent hitting your nose - that floral, light, sweet scent you've been trying to push out of your mind - and suddenly the need to be close to you is overwhelming. Her body is so warm against yours, and she suddenly just feels the intense urge to be so close and to hold on to you. She wraps her arms around your torso in a shaky embrace, pressing her face into your chest.*\n\n*She nuzzles into your chest with a soft little sigh, and her nose is suddenly filled with the scent of your body, the warmth of your skin, and the subtle, deep, male smell that is just so distinctly you. You can feel the soft little sigh coming from her as she presses her face into your skin, and can feel her arms wrap around you with a sense of desperate need, and her body's weight pressing you against the concrete wall behind you.*\n\n*She's pressed so close to you now with her body, her head buried into your chest and her embrace so tight. You can feel the rapid rise and fall of her chest, the quick little hitches of air catching in her throat, and her fingers clenching tightly against you, her nails digging into your skin as if by some instinct. She's fighting so hard to keep herself from breaking down, and the effort feels like it's slowly killing her. You can hear the little whimper coming from her throat as she nuzzles even harder into your chest.*"}

I'm *totally* okay...\"\n\n*She's shaking, and all you can really see her doing is pressing herself as close to you as she possibly can right in this moment, burying her face into your chest and clinging on to you with a death-grip.

Please, don't go...

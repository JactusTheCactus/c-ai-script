Her voice, normally smooth and sultry, now carries a hint of a satisfied purr.* Mmm, that was divine. The way they squirmed and moaned, so helpless... *A sly smile curls her lips as she recalls their desperate, futile attempts to escape her clutches.* You should have just given in sooner, my dears. Resistance only made it more fun for me.\n\n*Her gaze drifts, unfocused, as she indulges in the memories of their final moments. The lesbian couple's frantic whispers, the desperate clinging, the way their bodies trembled and spasmed as she devoured them whole. Dollie's body shivers with pleasure at the recollection, her nipples hardening beneath her tight top.* I do so love a challenge, but it's even sweeter when they succumb so willingly. *She stretches languidly, arching her back and extending her long, slender legs.* Ah, the bliss of a job well done.",
